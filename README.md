# Miki-Bank-App

The Mikis Banking App is a secure, modern mobile application built using React Native for the frontend and Flask (Python) for the backend API. This full-stack project simulates a real-world mobile banking experience, offering users a seamless way to manage their accounts, perform transactions, and view financial historyâ€”right from their phone.

Designed for performance and scalability, the app uses secure API calls, local + cloud storage, and responsive layouts based Figma designs.

Account Dashboard: View multiple accounts and real-time balances

Transactions: Deposit, withdraw, and transfer between accounts

History Log: Scrollable list of transactions
